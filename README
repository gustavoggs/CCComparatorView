ComparatorView is a class that extends the UIImageView, and it is designed to compare between one view and one image.

I created this because of the need to do pixel perfect screens, so this way I can compare the final result without going to photoshop.

How to use:

You just need to add a ComparatorView in your view and define the image, exact like you do in the UIImageView.

Pan up to increase the alpha
Pan down to decrease the alpha
Pan with two fingers to set the alpha to 0 and can use your app.
